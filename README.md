# Teacher Salary Calculator

## Overview

This simple Python script calculates the weekly earnings of a teacher based on the number of hours worked and the number of students in their class. The script prompts the user to input the number of hours worked and the number of students, then calculates and displays the total earnings for the week.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: The script prompts the user to enter the hours worked and the number of students in the class.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user inputs numeric values for both hours and students. If non-numeric input is detected (other than the exit command), the user is prompted to try again.
- **Formatted Output**: The calculated salary is displayed in a user-friendly format with two decimal places.
- **Exit Option**: The user can exit the program at any time by typing `end` during any input prompt.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

1. **Run the Script**: Start the script in a Python environment.
2. **Enter Hours Worked**: When prompted, input the number of hours you worked this week.
3. **Enter Number of Students**: Input the number of students in your class.
4. **View Earnings**: The script will calculate and display your earnings based on the provided inputs.
5. **Exit the Script**: You can exit the script by typing `end` when prompted for either hours worked or number of students.
